The process for applying for a personal loan will vary depending on the type of lender you work with. If you opt for a traditional bank or credit union, you may need to apply at a local branch or work with a loan agent to complete your application.

If you choose an online lender for your personal loan, the application process can go quite smoothly. You can complete your application online and, in most cases, relatively quickly.

Keep in mind that the more information you provide in your initial application, the more quickly your application will be processed. If you fail to provide proof of your income or employment, the lender may need additional time to request that information and process your application.
