While you can’t necessarily negotiate any elements of your loan, you can increase or decrease the amount of your monthly payment by adjusting your repayment term.

With a longer repayment term, you will have lower monthly payments. While this may seem like the more attractive option at face value, you’ll end up paying more in interest in the long run.

The shorter your repayment term, the higher your monthly payment will be. Because you pay your loan off more quickly with a shorter term, you’ll pay less in interest over your loan term. You may potentially get a lower interest rate with a shorter term.
